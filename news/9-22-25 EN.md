### <span style="color:blue;">TSMC's 3nm N3P Process Price Increase Impacts Qualcomm and MediaTek Chips</span>

Qualcomm and MediaTek are soon to officially release their flagship SoCs—the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and Dimensity 9500, both utilizing TSMC's latest 3nm N3P process. Although the process only offers a 5% performance boost and a 5-10% improvement in power efficiency, the N3P wafer price has increased by about 20% compared to the previous N3E. MediaTek is paying a 24% premium for the Dimensity 9500, and Qualcomm is paying a 16% premium for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Apple's A19/A19 Pro foundry fees are also increasing, but potentially by a smaller margin.

The rising cost of chip manufacturing will be passed on to OEM vendors, which is particularly detrimental to Android manufacturers and will affect flagship smartphone prices. In contrast, Apple, by absorbing the cost internally, might be less affected and potentially more competitive in its pricing.

Looking ahead, TSMC's 2nm process wafer cost is expected to rise by another 50%, but Apple has already reserved over half of the capacity. Supply for Qualcomm and MediaTek will be restricted, further escalating cost pressure on Android chips.

### <span style="color:blue;">DRAM and NAND Price Forecasts</span>

**Samsung Price Hikes**: Following earlier reports that Micron planned to raise DDR4/DDR5 prices by 20%–30%, Samsung Electronics recently notified major customers that DRAM prices will increase by 15-30% in Q4, and NAND flash prices will increase by 5-10%.

**October Market Price**: For the market as a whole, industry insiders [expect](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/19/news-ddr4-ddr5-october-prices-to-see-double-digit-gains-taiwans-dram-makers-poised-to-benefit/) DDR5 contract prices to rise by 10% to 15% in October, with spot prices increasing by 15% to 25%. DDR4 contract prices are expected to rise by over 10%, and spot prices by over 15%. This wave of memory price increases is anticipated to continue until the end of 2026.

**Q4 DRAM Price**: With the explosion of chip demand for AI, high-performance chips including HBM, GDDR7, and LPDDR5 are in short supply. Morgan Stanley recently predicted in a report that Q4 DRAM average prices will rise by 9% from current levels.

**NAND Price Expectation**: Furthermore, UBS forecasts that NAND flash prices will increase for three consecutive quarters: a 3% rise in Q3, a 5% rise in Q4, and another 3% rise in Q1 2026. The surge in eSSD demand driven by AI infrastructure is projected to result in a NAND flash supply gap of up to 8% in 2026, which will continue into 2027.

### <span style="color:blue;">Micron Earnings Previews</span>

Micron will announce its Q4 FY2025 earnings on Tuesday. Analysts anticipate revenue of $11.22 billion, a significant increase from $7.75 billion in the same period last year, marking the second consecutive record quarter (the previous quarter's record was $9.3 billion). The driving force behind the Q4 growth continues to be increased data center demand, including HBM and eSSD demand from hyperscale customers. Revenue growth for the next quarter is expected to stem more from rising average selling prices, and "although capital expenditure may increase over the coming quarters, revenue growth is likely to outpace spending growth." Please await the report following the earnings call for specific details.

### <span style="color:blue;">Additional Details on US-China TikTok Agreement</span>

According to negotiations from last Friday, ByteDance will lease a copy of its algorithm to the US-investor-led TikTok US company for operation. Leasing instead of selling ensures that ByteDance's other overseas operations are unaffected. However, this leasing agreement may face opposition because the previous ban stipulated a prohibition on "cooperation on the operation of content recommendation algorithms."

Oracle is responsible for verifying the algorithm retraining and protecting user data, ensuring the algorithm "operates in the US, separate from ByteDance's control." US users can continue to access global TikTok content. Trump is expected to sign an executive order approving the deal later this week, and to extend the suspension of the ban for 120 days until December to finalize details.

### <span style="color:blue;">Google Monopolization Case Update—Google Seeks to Avoid Selling its Ad Exchange AdX</span>

Google had considered selling parts of its ad tech business to avoid the Justice Department’s demand for a “full technical separation and divestiture” of its AdX trading platform. Today in court, Google explicitly stated that the DOJ's divestiture proposal is "technically infeasible and would lead to prolonged uncertainty for advertisers and publishers." Google proposed modifications to its policies to make it easier for publishers to use and support competing platforms. For instance, opening up its publisher ad server (DFP) for integration with third-party ad exchanges, reducing its bundling with AdX. Google may also agree to open-source non-core bidding technologies (like the real-time bidding protocol) to promote competition.

The trial is expected to last several weeks, with the judge determining the remedies. Google's stock price slightly dropped by 0.5% on September 22, reflecting cautious market expectations about the outcome. Experts predict the judge might lean towards behavioral remedies (like mandatory API opening), but if the DOJ provides sufficient evidence (e.g., proving Google continuously harms competition), a partial sale or stricter measures might be required. A judgment is expected in the coming months, which could reshape the online advertising market landscape.

### <span style="color:blue;">Global Smartphone Average Selling Price (ASP) Trends</span>

**Shipment Growth**: Counterpoint predicts that global smartphone shipments will grow by 2.5% year-over-year in 2025, an increase from the 1.9% forecast in Q1. Shipment slowdown is attributed to rising prices, supply chain reorganization, and macroeconomic pressures.

**ASP Growth**: The Average Selling Price (ASP) is expected to grow by 3.5% year-over-year in 2025, reaching $370, slightly higher than the previously expected 2.3% increase. This is thanks to rising ASP in North America and a price rebound in India and other parts of Asia Pacific, supported by economic recovery. The global smartphone ASP was $357 in 2024, is projected to reach $370 in 2025 (3.5% YoY growth), and $412 by 2029 (3% CAGR).

**Total Revenue Growth**: The combined effect of these two factors is expected to drive smartphone revenue growth by nearly 6% in 2025. In the long term, the rising trend in revenue and ASP will keep global smartphone revenue at a 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from 2025 to 2029.
